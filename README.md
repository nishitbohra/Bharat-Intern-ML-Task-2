# Iris Classification

# Import Libraries:
Import the necessary libraries for data handling, modeling, and evaluation.
# Load the Dataset:
Obtain the iris dataset, which includes features and target labels (species).
# Data Preprocessing:
If needed, perform data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, or scaling features. The iris dataset is often clean and doesn't require extensive preprocessing.
# Split the Data:
Divide the dataset into training and testing sets. A common split is 80% for training and 20% for testing.
# Choose the Naive Bayes Algorithm:
Select the appropriate variant of the Naive Bayes algorithm (e.g., Gaussian Naive Bayes for continuous features) based on the nature of your data.
# Train the Model:
Train the Naive Bayes model on the training data.
# Make Predictions:
Use the trained model to make predictions on the testing data.
# Evaluate the Model:
Assess the model's performance using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.
# Tune Hyperparameters (Optional):
Depending on your requirements, you can fine-tune hyperparameters or explore different variants of the Naive Bayes algorithm.
# Use the Model for Predictions :
After successful training, you can deploy the model to make predictions on new, unseen data.
